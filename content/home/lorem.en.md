You can add more sections to the home page by tagging markdown files with `type: home` or `type: about` in the yamls of the `content/home` folder.
New sections can also be added to the home page like the `content/about` page, creating a folder with an `_index.md` and settin `type: home`. 
More projects or blog sections can be added in the same way, creating folders with `_index.md` with `type: projects` or `type: blog`.
